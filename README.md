Snipmate Snippets
=================

This repository is a fork of **honza/snipmate-snippets**, more information on the project [here](https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets).

I removed all the snippets except for Ruby which I prefixed with `$` to avoid annoying conflits with supertab completions.
